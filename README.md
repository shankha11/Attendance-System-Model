# Attendance System Model

## Description
The Attendance System Model project is designed to automate student attendance tracking using advanced facial recognition technology. This system leverages a machine learning model to detect and identify students in real-time via webcam, efficiently recording their attendance and generating detailed logs for each session.

## Files
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `Student_images`: The Student_images directory should contain the images of students that system uses for face recognition.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing model training code.
- `attendance_2024-09-04.csv`: To create a CSV file that logs the attendance details of students detected by the system on the current date.
- `Model`: It contains the serialized version of the trained Attendance System Model.
